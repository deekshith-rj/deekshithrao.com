            The database migration is causing a problem, so I'll need to fix that first! 
            The migration has worked fine, but the project page field panels are not showing up in the admin
    # Frontend
        # Convert projects.jsx into a folder, and add initial [slug] page based on articles/[slug] page
    # TODO: The page meta title is showing "About - Deekshtih Rao" - incorrect    
# TODO: About page - upgrade to add paragraph breaks, headings, perhaps a pic etc.
# TODO: Consider adding a "Contact" page and perhaps a 'mailto:' link in the social media links
